# HW2
## Devlog
  The breakdown activity plan I made for MG2 was a pretty accurate plan that I followed to actually make MG2. I created a script named Player, and gave it a collider with input receiving code that detects when space is pressed. Somethings not noted in the plan is that I used rigidbody for the jumping mechanic, where I called rb.AddForce whenever space is pressed. I also used Physics2D.Raycast to detect the ground so that only when the ground is detected, isGrounded will become true, and thus allow jumping. The player will also collect the coins, as drawn on the plan, and to do this, I give coins the tag "Collectible", so that whenever player OnTriggerEnter2D with a object that is tagged with "Collectible", the game controller will update the UI by incrementing the points displayed by 1. Speaking about game controller, instead of referencing the UI from the player as drawn in the plan, I created a game manager script instead in the actual build, where the game manager references the UI, and the player references the game manager, and the player can call the UpdateUI() from the game manager reference. 

  
  The coin is also designed pretty closely to how it was planned out. The coin constantly moves left by calling transform.Translate() in its update method. However, how it is destroyed outside of the camera is different than what was planned. Instead of having a collider outside of the camera, where if the coin touches it, it destroys itself, I gave the coin a lifetime attributes, so that if lifetime amount of time has passed, auto destroy the coin. Our coin spawner was consistent with the plan too with some details ommitted in the drawing. I used an empty object, and placed it to the left and outside of the camera, and attached a coin spawner script to it. The coin spawner script calls SpawnCoin(), which instantiates a coin prefab at the spawner's transform.position, at a random interval between 0.5 seconds to 2 seconds. This is done by storing a random value using Random.Range(0.5f, 2f), to an attribute named timeForNextSpawn inside the SpawnCoin() method. Inside the Update method of the coin spawner, I decrease the value of timeForNextSpawn, and if the time is <= 0, the code calls SpawnCoin().
